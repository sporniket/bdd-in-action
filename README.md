## 1. What is **bdd-in-action**, and when to use it ?

**bdd-in-action** is a tutorial to build a REST-ish service from scratch using Spring-boot, following the principle of Behavior Driven Development.

This tutorial project is managed as following :

* A **branch** will focus on a specific stack defined by : the JDK version, the JUnit version, the Spring-boot version.
* The project will use Spring-jersey, in other words JAX-RS (JSR-370). This choice allow an easier migration from other JAX-RS based framework, like RestEASY.
* The **issues** are organised to design the project from scratch. They deal with progressively address the various requirement (in short, be addressable through http protocol, use a database, use external apis), and at the same time, they serve as functionnal specifications with a user story and a test suite. Some issue are purely technical, in order to setup a specific tool to enhance the quality of the codebase.
* In a given branch, each issue will be dealt with in order, with a unique commit. In other words, the first commit of the branch resolves the issue #1, the second commit resolves issue #2, and so on...
* Issues will stay open, since it is part of the reference material.
* **Any commit in the _master_ branch will be followed by a rebase of each tutorial branch !**

**bdd-in-action** is a project for a fictionnal company named 'Little Cauldron ltd.' that produces and sells little cauldron for personnal use. It want to build a webstore consisting of a dedicated api to manage its catalog of products. This project will be called 'api-catalog'.

### Starting the local database instances

You will need docker and docker-compose :

```
Docker version 19.03.2, build 6a30dfc
docker-compose version 1.21.2, build a133471
```

* The first time, and then each time you want to drop your development database to restart from scratch

```
./resetDevDb.bash
```

* Start the database instances (we force a `docker-compose down` to drop and recreate from scratch the CI database)

```
docker-compose down && docker-compose up
```

* Explore the databases using adminer :Â 
[development](http://localhost:50080/?pgsql=db-dev&username=lcaadmin&db=postgres&ns=lca&auth[driver]=pgsql)
[continuous integration](http://localhost:50080/?pgsql=db-ci&username=lcaadmin&db=postgres&ns=lca&auth[driver]=pgsql)
